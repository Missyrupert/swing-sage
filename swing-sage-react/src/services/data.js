    title: "The Gate Drill",
    description: "Place two headcovers or tees just outside the heel and toe of your driver. The goal is to swing through this 'gate' without hitting either marker, promoting a square clubface at impact."
  },
  {
    category: 'Putting',
    title: "The Ladder Drill",
    description: "Place golf balls at 3, 6, 9, and 12 feet from the hole. Start at 3 feet and don't move to the next 'rung' of the ladder until you've made the putt. Great for building pressure putting skills."
  },
  {
    category: 'Chipping',
    title: "The Towel Drill",
    description: "Lay a towel on the green about 5-10 feet from you. Practice chipping balls so they land on the towel and then roll out to the hole. This masters your landing spot and trajectory control."
  },
  {
    category: 'Putting',
    title: "The Clock Drill",
    description: "Place four balls around the hole at 3 feet in the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. Go around the clock making each one. This helps you master short putts from every angle."
  },
  {
    category: 'Driving',
    title: "The Whoosh Drill",
    description: "Flip your driver upside down and hold the shaft near the head. Make your normal swing, focusing on making the 'whoosh' sound happen LOUDEST after the point where the ball would be. This trains speed in the right part of the swing."
