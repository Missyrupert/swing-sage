Claude Megaprompt: Swing Sage Rebuild & AI Integration ‚Äì Phase 2

Claude, this is the part where you take over. I‚Äôve built the foundation of what‚Äôs meant to become the best AI-powered golf coaching platform on the internet ‚Äî a site called Swing Sage. It‚Äôs structurally wired up, many files are already in place, and the front-end connects successfully to a functioning backend with AWS integration. Video uploads are routed through S3 and appear to work, allowing swings to be stored and shared ‚Äî although I‚Äôm not 100% sure on the setup, and I welcome your guidance on whether this has been implemented securely, efficiently, and correctly.

What I Need You to Do:
Your job is to do all the heavy lifting from here. Think of this as a flagship project ‚Äî a site with serious ambition behind it, designed to serve golfers of all abilities with world-class coaching content, elegant UI, intuitive features, and intelligent AI analysis. This is not a toy. This is a potential livelihood, built from months of my time, personal energy, and belief that we can outclass the competition with the right structure, polish, and content.

I want full feature completion, design upgrades, content generation, and a working AI system that integrates:
- swing analysis feedback,
- personalised coaching tips,
- mindset advice,
- and much more.

Swing Sage Must Include (You May Re-Architect if Needed):

‚úÖ Already Started or Wired In:
- AWS-backed video uploads (check implementation, clean up UX)
- Frontend with base components and layout
- Swing analysis placeholder system

üß† Now Needs Full Execution:
- AI Tip Generator: Contextual, skill-level-based swing or course advice
- Coach‚Äôs Corner: Quotes and coaching drills from top 20 golf minds
- Rules & Etiquette: Interactive summaries by player group (kids, seniors, new golfers)
- Wisdom & Wit: Humorous analogies and memorable coaching phrases
- Course Strategy: Shot selection, position play, on-course thinking
- Mental Game Zone: Performance mindset, handling pressure, focus builders
- Mythbusters: Clear up common coaching misconceptions (e.g. ‚Äúkeep your head down‚Äù)
- Save & Share: Simple UX to store favourite tips or send video breakdowns
- Dynamic Content Areas: Context-aware, reactive UI components (like ‚ÄúTip of the Day‚Äù)

Tech & UX Expectations:
- Keep a dark theme with green accents, modern, polished, and slightly futuristic
- Ensure accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and intuitive design throughout
- Sidebar on desktop, hamburger menu on mobile
- Add subtle transitions (hover effects, fade-ins, tip reveals)
- Optimise AI analysis flow ‚Äî this is the star of the show
- Audit and improve backend-AWS wiring if anything looks inefficient, insecure, or clunky
- Keep external libraries minimal unless critical for performance or design

Output Guidelines (Very Important):
1. Always explain what you‚Äôre changing or building (brief summary is fine).
2. Provide complete file replacements (e.g. full index.html, style.css, script.js) ‚Äî do not give snippets that require manual insertion. I do not want to figure out what lines to replace.
3. Label each file clearly and group by function or feature.
4. When generating content, aim for clarity, usefulness, and real-world golfing insight ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs from AI or trusted knowledge sources.

Once You‚Äôve Built the Next Version:

Give me a straight-talking to-do list with:
- Which files to replace and where
- Any .env keys or AWS credentials I need to check
- Any folders or routes that need adjusting
- Clear technical or manual steps I should complete to finish the work

Keep this final checklist laser-focused ‚Äî assume I‚Äôve got drive and vision, but limited patience for hunting through broken paths or fixing half-wired features.

Final Note:
This isn‚Äôt just a site. It represents years of thought, months of effort, and possibly my future income. If it hits the mark, Swing Sage will be one of the most respected AI-driven golf sites online ‚Äî used by beginners, weekend warriors, club-level players, and curious hackers alike.

This means everything to me. Don‚Äôt just code. Build it like it‚Äôs yours.
